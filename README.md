# Flask Web App Tutorial

In this project, I've built a web application with Python using Flask. 
This is a simple note taking application that allows the user to sign up, sign in, take notes and delete note, and finally logout. 
To achieve the above functionalities, I've used the Jinja framework for the front end HTML code, used the autentication packages for the security check and had connected with the database. 

## Setup & Installation

Make sure you have the latest version of Python installed.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running The App

```bash
python main.py
```

## Viewing The App
